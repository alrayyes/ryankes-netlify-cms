This is a quick tutorial to teach you how to integrate your [Last.fm feed](http://www.last.fm/user/alrayyes) into [your hugo site](/tunes). To keep things nice and simple I've created a [demo theme](https://github.com/alrayyes/lastfm-hugo-demo-theme) to get you started, which you can see running [here](https://lastfm-hugo-demo.ryankes.eu/).

The demo is basically a one page template. I've highlighted the important part.

```html{31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42}

```
