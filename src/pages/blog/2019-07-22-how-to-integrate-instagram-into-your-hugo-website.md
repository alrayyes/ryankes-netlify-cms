~~This is a quick tutorial to teach you how to integrate your [Instagram feed](http://instagram.com/alrayyes) into your hugo site~~ [^1]. To keep things nice and simple I've created a [demo theme](https://github.com/alrayyes/instagram-hugo-demo-theme) to get you started, which you can see running [here](https://instagram-hugo-demo.ryankes.eu/).

The demo is basically a one page template. I've highlighted the important part.​

[^1]: You really shouldn't be using products [owned by Facebook](https://www.stopusingfacebook.co/). Personally I don't use [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) anymore, and therefore don't have a working demo to show. At the time of writing Facebook is [closing down the Instagram API](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/facebook-instagram-api-shut-down/) so all of this probably won't work in the not too distant future.​
