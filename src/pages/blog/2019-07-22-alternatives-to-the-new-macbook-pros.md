  Like a lot of you I was somewhat unenamoured with the new 2016 Mac book Pro
  lineup. A stupid touch bar does not an innovation make. Quite frankly I was a
  bit pissed off having waited 2 years for them to refresh the Mac book Pro only
  to be rewarded with lackluster hardware and a price markup. So yeah screw you
  Apple, it's time to checkout some alternatives.

Like a lot of you I was somewhat unenamoured with the new [2016 Macbook Pro lineup](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/apple-unveils-groundbreaking-new-macbook-pro.html). A stupid touch bar does not an innovation make. Quite frankly I was a bit pissed off having waited 2 years for them to refresh the Macbook Pro only to be rewarded with lacklustre hardware and a price markup. So yeah screw you Apple, it's time to checkout some alternatives.

I have a few prequisites of course: 

##### At least 16 GB RAM 
As I do most of my development using Docker containers more memory is always good. Ideally I would love 32 GB but I can live with 16. 

##### 13-15" screen 
13" is acceptable, 15" is nicer 

##### Nice resolution 
1920x1080 just doesn't cut it any more. 

After doing some research and watching/reading quite a few reviews & Hackernews/Reddit comments I've come up with the following alternatives: 

* [Dell XPS 13](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/productdetails/xps-13-9350-laptop) 
* [Dell XPS 15](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/productdetails/xps-15-9550-laptop) 

So to compare prices (I'm in Holland, so prices will be in euros) I've decided to compare the 13" & 15" Mac Pros configurated to my specifications to the competition.
