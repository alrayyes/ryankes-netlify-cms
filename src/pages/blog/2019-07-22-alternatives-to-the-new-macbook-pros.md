  Like a lot of you I was somewhat unenamoured with the new 2016 Mac book Pro
  lineup. A stupid touch bar does not an innovation make. Quite frankly I was a
  bit pissed off having waited 2 years for them to refresh the Mac book Pro only
  to be rewarded with lackluster hardware and a price markup. So yeah screw you
  Apple, it's time to checkout some alternatives.
