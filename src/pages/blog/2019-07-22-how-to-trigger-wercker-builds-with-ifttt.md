  In a previous post I explained how to trigger Wercker builds using their api.
  Call the api endpoint in a cronjob once in a while and boom you're done. This
  is swell for cases like my lastm demo page which gets updated regularly, but
  what about the Instagram demo page? As I'm not a 15 year old girl I don't feel
  the need to Instagram my life to the world 24 / 7. Ideally I only want a build
  to be triggered every time I upload a photo.
