As I've pointed out a few times this site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). In this post I'm going to try to point out some of the pros and cons, so lets get into it.

To paraphrase Douglas Adams:

> "The static site generator landscape is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it’s daunting choosing a web framework, but that’s just peanuts to the static site generator landscape."

Just to give you a taste here's a list I've ~~stolen~~ copied from [staticsitegenerators.net](https://staticsitegenerators.net/):​

That's quite a lot to choose from. Personally I have experience with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so that will be my frame of reference. Here are my personal pros and cons concerning Hugo, from a beginners perspective:

---

## Pros

- Hugo is fast. I mean really really fast. Stupid fast. [Run Forrest Run fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyCGEHYvgsU).
- Easy to setup (well, compared to Middleman at least). No Ruby or Node versioning issues to contend with, just install the Hugo binary and you're good to go
- Hugo can talk to data feeds nicely. It's [data driven content](https://gohugo.io/extras/datadrivencontent/) features make it a [piece]({{< ref "/posts/integrating-instagram-into-your-hugo-site.md" >}}) of [cake]({{< ref "/posts/integrating-lastfm-into-your-hugo-site.md" >}}) to generate html based on json/csv feeds.
- [Pagination](https://gohugo.io/extras/pagination/) is easy to iplement
- Writing your own ~~helpers~~[shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/) is dead easy
- Decent support for [traversing local files](https://gohugo.io/extras/localfiles/)
- Helpful [community](http://discuss.gohugo.io/)
- Good [documentation](https://gohugo.io)
- [Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/) & [Taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/taxonomies/overview/) provide an easy way to handle content metadata
- [Handy](https://github.com/SenjinDarashiva/JekyllToHugo) [tools](https://github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo) [to](https://github.com/codebrane/octohug) [migrate](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter) [from](https://github.com/danapsimer/drupal2hugo) [other](https://github.com/natefinch/blogimport) [platforms](https://github.com/ArnoNuyts/contentful2hugo)
- Loads of [free themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/) that work out of the box (this site is based on [GridSide](http://themes.gohugo.io/grid-side/))
- An easy to learn [template language](https://gohugo.io/templates/functions/)

## Cons

- [Multilingual](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/create-a-multilingual-site/) isn't quite supported yet out of the box and is fidgety to set up
- No XML support for data feeds. Only JSON/CSV
- Asset management/compilation isn't built in and is a pain in the ass to set up. At the time of writing there's [Huggle](https://github.com/ktmud/huggle) & [Hugulp](https://github.com/jbrodriguez/hugulp). They both have their pros and cons and try to solve the asset problem admirably but still feel clunky as they're not part of Hugo. Middleman is much more flexible and feature rich in this regard

I haven't really got much more to say on the matter. If you want a static site generator that's fast and just works you could do much worse than Hugo. As always, I look forward to reading your opinions in the comments below.
