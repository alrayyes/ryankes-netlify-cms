Just finished [Black Mirror Season 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Black_Mirror_episodes#Series_3_.282016.29) and I've decided to rank the episodes based on my personal preference. To the unititiated here's the wikipedia definition:

> Black Mirror is a British television drama series created by Charlie Brooker. The series is produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. Regarding the programme's content and structure, Brooker noted, "each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. But they're all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy."

If I had to give an analogy it's basically [Ghost In The Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex) meets [The Twilight Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone) meets [Serial Experiments Lain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain), set in the not too distant future. Black Mirror explores themes and issues attributed to recent advances in social media and computers/networking in general.

Obligatory spoiler warning, I strongly recommended watching season 3 first before reading this. All the episodes are great and worth watching. Without further ado, my list:

#### 6 Men Against Fire
